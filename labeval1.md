Of course\! It sounds like you have an important evaluation coming up. Let's get you fully prepared. I'll provide a comprehensive guide covering the key concepts and all the necessary Verilog codes, with a special focus on **Lab 7: Flip-Flops**, as you requested.

### **Core Concepts for Your Evaluation**

Before we dive into the code, let's solidify the fundamental ideas. Understanding these will help you answer any viva questions confidently.

1.  **Combinational vs. Sequential Circuits:**

    - **Combinational:** The output depends _only_ on the current inputs. Think of basic logic gates (AND, OR), adders, and multiplexers. They have no memory.
    - **Sequential:** The output depends on _both_ the current inputs and the _past sequence_ of inputs. This is because they have **memory**. Flip-flops are the basic building blocks of sequential circuits.

2.  **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Reset:** This is a crucial concept for flip-flops.

    - **Asynchronous Reset:** The reset happens **immediately**, regardless of the clock signal. It's a dominant, overriding input. In Verilog, it appears in the sensitivity list: `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)`.
    - **Synchronous Reset:** The reset only happens on the **active clock edge**. The circuit waits for the next clock pulse to reset. In Verilog, the reset signal is _not_ in the sensitivity list: `always @(posedge clk)`.

3.  **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments:** This is a common point of confusion.

    - **Blocking (`=`):** Used for **combinational** logic. Statements are executed one after another, in order. The result of one line is immediately available for the next line in the same `always` block.
    - **Non-Blocking (`<=`):** Used for **sequential** logic (flip-flops, registers). All assignments in an `always` block happen **concurrently** at the end of the block, based on the values at the _start_ of the block. **Rule of thumb: If you have a `posedge clk` in your `always` block, use non-blocking assignments (`<=`).**

## **Lab 7: Flip-Flops (Detailed Breakdown)**

Here are the complete, ready-to-run Verilog codes for every exercise in Lab 7.

### **1. D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Active-High Reset**

This is the simplest flip-flop. The output `Q` takes the value of the input `D` on the positive edge of the clock. The reset is asynchronous, meaning it can happen at any time.

#### **Verilog Code (`d_ff_async.v`)**

```verilog
// D Flip-Flop with positive-edge clock and asynchronous active-high reset
module d_ff_async (
    input wire D,
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset, // Active-high reset
    output reg Q
);

    // Sensitivity list includes both clock and reset for asynchronous behavior
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin // If reset is high...
            Q <= 1'b0;   // ...immediately set Q to 0.
        end else begin
            Q <= D;      // Otherwise, on the clock edge, Q gets D.
        end
    end

endmodule
```

#### **Testbench (`tb_d_ff_async.v`)**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_d_ff_async;
    reg D, clk, reset;
    wire Q;

    d_ff_async uut (.D(D), .clk(clk), .reset(reset), .Q(Q));

    // Clock generation
    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #10 clk = ~clk; // 20ns period clock
    end

    // Test stimulus
    initial begin
        $dumpfile("d_ff_async.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, tb_d_ff_async);

        // 1. Apply reset
        reset = 1; D = 1; #15; // Reset is high, D is ignored

        // 2. De-assert reset and test D input
        reset = 0; #10;
        D = 1; #20;
        D = 0; #20;
        D = 1; #20;

        // 3. Test asynchronous reset again (mid-cycle)
        D = 0; #10;
        reset = 1; #15; // Reset will force Q to 0 immediately
        reset = 0; #20;

        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

### **2. T Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Active-Low Reset**

The T flip-flop toggles its output (`Q` becomes `~Q`) when input `T` is high. This one is negative-edge triggered and has an active-low reset.

#### **Verilog Code (`t_ff_async.v`)**

```verilog
// T Flip-Flop with negative-edge clock and asynchronous active-low reset
module t_ff_async (
    input wire T,
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset_n, // Active-low reset
    output reg Q
);
    initial Q = 0; // Initialize Q to a known state

    // Sensitive to negative clock edge or falling edge of reset
    always @(negedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
        if (!reset_n) begin // If reset_n is LOW...
            Q <= 1'b0;      // ...immediately reset Q to 0.
        end else if (T) begin
            Q <= ~Q;        // If T is high, toggle Q on negedge clk.
        end
        // If T is low, Q holds its value (implicit)
    end

endmodule
```

#### **Testbench (`tb_t_ff_async.v`)**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_t_ff_async;
    reg T, clk, reset_n;
    wire Q;

    t_ff_async uut (.T(T), .clk(clk), .reset_n(reset_n), .Q(Q));

    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #10 clk = ~clk;
    end

    initial begin
        $dumpfile("t_ff_async.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, tb_t_ff_async);

        // 1. Apply active-low reset
        reset_n = 0; T = 1; #15;

        // 2. De-assert reset and test toggle
        reset_n = 1; #10;
        T = 1; // Enable toggling
        #80; // Let it run for 4 clock cycles

        T = 0; // Disable toggling, Q should hold
        #40;

        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

### **3. JK Flip-Flop with Synchronous Active-High Reset**

The JK flip-flop is the most versatile. This implementation has a synchronous reset, meaning the reset only takes effect on a positive clock edge.

| J   | K   | Next State (Q+) | Action |
| --- | --- | --------------- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | Q               | Hold   |
| 0   | 1   | 0               | Reset  |
| 1   | 0   | 1               | Set    |
| 1   | 1   | \~Q             | Toggle |

#### **Verilog Code (`jk_ff_sync.v`)**

```verilog
// JK Flip-Flop with positive-edge clock and synchronous active-high reset
module jk_ff_sync (
    input wire J, K, clk, reset,
    output reg Q
);
    initial Q = 0; // Initialize

    // Sensitivity list ONLY includes the clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin      // If reset is high on the clock edge...
            Q <= 1'b0;        // ...reset Q.
        end else begin
            case ({J, K})
                2'b00: Q <= Q;      // Hold
                2'b01: Q <= 1'b0;   // Reset
                2'b10: Q <= 1'b1;   // Set
                2'b11: Q <= ~Q;     // Toggle
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

#### **Testbench (`tb_jk_ff_sync.v`)**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_jk_ff_sync;
    reg J, K, clk, reset;
    wire Q;

    jk_ff_sync uut (.J(J), .K(K), .clk(clk), .reset(reset), .Q(Q));

    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #10 clk = ~clk;
    end

    initial begin
        $dumpfile("jk_ff_sync.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, tb_jk_ff_sync);

        // Test synchronous reset
        reset = 1; J = 1; K = 1; #25; // Reset will activate on the next posedge

        // De-assert reset and test all JK states
        reset = 0;
        J = 1; K = 0; #20; // Set
        J = 0; K = 0; #20; // Hold
        J = 1; K = 1; #20; // Toggle
        J = 1; K = 1; #20; // Toggle again
        J = 0; K = 1; #20; // Reset
        J = 0; K = 0; #20; // Hold

        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

## **Commands to Run Any of These Simulations**

To run any of the examples above, follow these three steps in your terminal. I'll use the D Flip-Flop as an example:

1.  **Save the files**: Save the code into `d_ff_async.v` and `tb_d_ff_async.v`.
2.  **Compile the code**:
    ```bash
    iverilog -o my_sim d_ff_async.v tb_d_ff_async.v
    ```
3.  **Run the simulation and view the waveform**:
    ```bash
    vvp my_sim
    gtkwave d_ff_async.vcd
    ```

Good luck with your evaluation\! Review these concepts and codes, and you'll be well-prepared.
